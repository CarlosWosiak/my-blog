# About the repository

This little project of mine is my blog, it is under construction.

# Tech stack

Just some React consuming a blog posts api then displaying it.

# Want to run it?
To run it install the dependencies with:
```sh    
    npm install
```
or
```sh
    yarn  
```
you must set a REACT_APP_API_URL key in the .env file, the api must return the posts in a '/post' route.
Then start it with the command: 
```sh
    npm run dev
```
or 
```sh
   yarn dev
```


Have fun! ðŸ˜‰
